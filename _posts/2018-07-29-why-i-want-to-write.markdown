Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion with signs and symbols.  - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing)

I believe that nothing like the above paragraph can describe “writing” and show the importance of it for humans. All of this aside, for me, there was another goal, which led me to create this Blog and writing posts. for two considerable reasons, writing posts turn out to be convincing for me.

### Personal Reasons:

for several years I was hungry for talking about my own opinions to people around me and receiving their comments, discuss on topics that I love, embrace new ideas, but I need quite a long time before I realized that I can satisfy this need with blogging and writing note upon anything which I desire.

Although I could fulfill most of this need with talking to my friends and colleagues, yet there is a pleasure in expanding your ideas through notes. Moreover, when you are writing about things, you have more time to think about your ideas and shape them correctly.

### My Career:

As a developer and computer specialist (if I can call that to myself), I encounter to delightful subjects every day that I have to learn, so I think to myself why I don’t teach them to others while I can? just right after I studied them. so I found this blog a way to share my little knowledge with somebody who may interests.

Also finding folks that have the same interests as me is important because I can introduce myself to them clearly and befriend them more than before. I believe every person you face every day, brings you a new opportunity. thus finding new friends helps you to expand your career more than before.

In conclusion, writing on a blog can benefit you in different aspects which can lead to a greater life. You will find yourself a better person once you start writing because you have to think about every word you are going to write.
